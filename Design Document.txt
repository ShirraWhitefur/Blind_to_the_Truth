		Color picking
			Main Background - For when there are no other background graphics in use.
			Textbox Background
			Namebox Background (Likely same as the textbox.)
			Button-UI colors:
				Not Selectable ("Grayed out")
				Selectable
					Active (Such as, you've selected that you want to have the display in Windowed mode)
					Inactive (But you could select Fullscreen over there.)
						These two will also help show which menu's you're currently in.
			  Have both a background color for the button, and foreground color for the text.  Can be done with 'glow' around the text to make it even more legible in some cases.
			Character colors:
				One color of speech per character, and color for their name.  Likely to be the same.  Make sure they're readable against the textbox background.
